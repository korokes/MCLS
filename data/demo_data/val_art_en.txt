hi this is karen for expert village okay let 's peel and chop our onions we 'll start by just trimming off the tip there and removing any the loose skins and cut the onion half like this . just trim off the little root section and peel off that outer brown skin now to chop an onion you want to leave that little root section on there . and when you cut down to your onion you only cut in here you start there you do n't want to cut the onion from here because then the whole onion falls apart , if you start in this area and then slice down it will hold the onion together , see how the onion stays together . and then you can just slice straight across and you get a nice medium cut onion and then you can just at that point cut up the rest the roots section . set that aside and then continue with our other onions just take off a little of that and peel it off , and by keeping the onion together like this it helps to cut down on the amount of onion vapors you get to because your not chop chopping everywhere with the onions going everywhere it stays compacted , and it 's very quick to cut an onion like this . just continue that with all your onions now i 'm going to show you how to peel and chop the garlic the easy way to get the skin off of the garlic is to take a flat a big knife a flat knife and just push with the palm of your hand to crush the garlic and the skin will fall right off . another way to crush the garlic is to take a steardy glass or jar and just give that a little whack that also crush the garlic and the peel just comes right off , i 'm just going to rough chop this garlic and add it to our onions next we 'll prep the leak .
i hope this becomes very popular , here of late , is the circle hooks . now , circle hooks has been used by japanese fishermen and longliners for years and years , but in recent years , they 've developed lighter , smaller , in shore type hooks , which are very well suited , particularly to folks that are in to the hook and release type fishing . this hook , basically is designed , to catch the fish in the corner of the mouth . now this type of hook , when you get a bite , you ca n't jerk the rod to set the hook . you basically just reel down , and get the line tight , and the fish will take off , and when he does , he usually turns , and this hook comes right in the corner of his mouth , and it sort of acts , really like a , kind of like a bottle opener . once you get it in there , it is very difficult to remove this hook , so if you catch a lot of fish , when you hook up the fish , you rarely ever lose them because of that particular mechanism . the nice thing about the circle hook is , you do n't gut hook a lot of fish . you do n't damage a lot of fish . you simply get him up to the boat . if you want to release him , you can release him , or cut the hook out , and it 's a pretty , it 's a pretty friendly hook , for fishing .
